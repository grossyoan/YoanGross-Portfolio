# WebDev Course - Sci-Fi UI

## Introduction

You have always dreamed of controlling earth ? Say no more, you are in the right place ! You're a big Sci-Fi fan ? Make it double, because we've got both of it here !

## Installation

For an optimized experience use a 1080p monitor. To avoid any bug (At least to minimize it) use an up-to-date internet browser. I said an Internet Browser, so don't talk about Edge of Internet Explorer ;)

## Features

- Dynamic hour display in the settings panel.
- OnMouse Parallax effet on background and UI.
- Switch On/Off Parallax options, for both UI and background.
- Reacting on hover Vibe'O'Meter.
- Interactive FIRE! button. (BUT DON'T CLICK ON IT!)
- Automatic Power Supply animation
- On + and - click Power Supply state changer.
- Automatic Curve'O'Meter animation loader
- Automatic warning clocks animation.
- Initialization panel animation.
- The most complete user guide on earth ! (Or space ? It's kind of confusing..)
- IPan logo reacting on hover.

## Known issues

- The responsive is totally broken.
- Setting button borders stay white on the first click, and then just shine.
- I wanted to put will-change on my dynamic content, but I couldn't get it to work properly so I    deleted all the will-change properties. So the website isn't optimized as much as it should be.
