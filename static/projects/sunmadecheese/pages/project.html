                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>The SunMade Cheese project is more about enjoying solar power and promoting education for solar technology, but the Solar Cow is really a lifeline for people. They are two projects for two different perspectives, but combined in one initiative.</p>
                <p>The milk produced by cows sustains life, and our solar cow sustains education. We loved the idea of using the cow as a symbol to show our commitment to sustainability and philosophy of ‘Solar for all’.     </p>

            <h1>"Solar Cow Project in Africa, solar for everyone"</h1>
            <p>One of YOLK’s core values is “Solar for Everyone”. In line with that philosophy, the team prepared for this project by delivering and installing a Solar Cow at a primary school in Pokot, Kenya and gave power banks that can be charged from the Solar cow to the students. </p>

            <h1>"Solar Cow is made to solve very specific problem,<br> Child Labor."</h1>
            <p>Cheese is a perfect link for the Solar Cow and a great way for us to connect the two projects. When we started the Solar Cow project, we focused on sustainability and the cheese part naturally followed. Not only because cheese is made from milk, but because it’s a casual thing.  Almost everyone loves cheese,  it’s kind of a mundane thing that is a part of everyday life. I thought it would be a great way to connect the two projects as well as bring coherence and harmony.</p>
            <p> The Solar Cow can be a powerful solution where electricity is essential due to the usage of cell phone but the cost of electricity is highly expensive compared to income and living expenses.  YOLK chose the East Africa based on those elements.</p>
