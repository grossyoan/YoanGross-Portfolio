### Installing

We recommend using FireFox if you decide to edit or fork this project locally.

If you enconter any issues about `Cross origin requests` an easy way to fix is to proceed like this :

1. Open Firefox browser and in the address bar type **_about:config_** and hit Enter button.
2. Click on **I’ll be careful, I promise!** Button.
3. In search box type **_origin_**.
4. Look for `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` option.
5. Double click on `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` will change the status from true to false.

And that should fix the problem !

Also, you'll need a **[SASS compiler](http://koala-app.com/)** to edit our website.

We know it's far from perfect, but it was a limited time project and we learned a lot !

Have fun modifying it :+1:
